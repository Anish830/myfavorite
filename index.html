  <p> If anyone hasn't found out by now my favorite hobby is gaming and for many reasons. When I play a video game I get to escape the worries and troubles of the real world and take a nice relaxing trip to the virtual world. It is a way for me to calm down after a stressful day and a great way to communicate with my friends, I just have to invite them when they are playing and we can play together and talk. It's also very fun and interesting, I like to play mainly Fortnite, Roblox and Brawl stars. But the main reason my hobby is gaming is because when i grow up I want to be a game developer so I like to analyze the game and look at how it was made, I also found some glitches in quite a few games where I can take a look at the code for that part of the game. That is why gaming is my favorite hobby </p>

        <h1>My Inspiration: Tim Sweeney</h1>
        <p>Tim Sweeeney is a game dev and the founder of Epic games. He is my idol because he is a very good game dev and I hope to be one day a game developer my self. My second reason why I like him so much is because his company Epic Games made two of my favorite games, Fortnite and Rocket league.</p>
